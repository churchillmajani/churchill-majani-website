            <h2>About Me</h2>
            My full name is Churchill Majani.I was born in the Western region of Kenya;Mbale in Vihiga to be particular.I am currently 19 years old and just completed my Highschool education and managed to attain a B in the Natinal Examinations.I am neither an introvert nor an extrovert;just somewhere in-between.I mean I socialize but not as much as I used to.I am currently learning and trying to master coding.Some of the projects I have managed to complete include:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The Little Taco shop
                    <a href="https://github.com/churchillmajani/the-little-taco-project">GitHub link</a>
                    <p>
                        This was my first project and it was quite demanding but thrilling as I now got to do the practical bit of creating a website.It took me some sleepless nights to complete but nonetheless I managed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Acme Rockets Website
                    <a href="https://github.com/churchillmajani/tailwind-acme">GitHub link</a>
                    <p>
                        This was now after I had learnt about Tailwind CSS and was required to create a website for a rocket company called Acme.I got to incorporate the Tailwind CSS knowledge I had gathered.Just like the first project,this also had me working throughout the night until I coded the website to fruition.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
                <h3>Why join DirectEd?</h3>
                <p>Since as far back as I can remember,technology has always fascinated me.I have always wanted to know how things work as they do and also seeing many movies with hackers and programmers made me even more drawn to do what they did.I thus dove deeper and found that the IT Department is broader than I thought.I thus decided that I was going to learn a little bit of everything related to IT.Then,as if an answered prayer,just after finishing my KCSE I learnt about DirectEd.I loved Directed because:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        They were offering to teach me a coding course for free that usually cost thousands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They were giving me an opportunity to learn and interact with the best in this field
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Having finished my National examinations and having nothing better to do,It was a good opportunity to keep my self constructively occupied.
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <summary>What am I proud of?</summary>
        <p>
            Growing up I was always shy and afraid.I did not like change and the thought of not knowing always scared me.I was smart and I aced my exams.Unfortunately,at the end of class three,my mum got transferred and thus we had to switch schools.I honestly hated it-the change-but I had no choice.(My mum is a teacher).When I sat for my first exam in standard four,I did not know most of the questions and I knew I was going to fail.But surprise!surprise!.I was the leading with 401 marks.I thought this would help me make friends but contrary to my expectations,it got me alot of enemies.Their constant whispers and intimidation got to me and it started affecting my results.I noticed this and really started working on my grades again.When I finally started acing them again after a streak of failing,the rumors began.The most prominent one was that my mum was sneaking me exam papers she knew we were to sit and that we would revise them before the main exam.I was secluded and some went as far as publicly telling me what they thought of me.Now this really did a number on me.Luckily,my mum noticed and gave me 'The Talk'.She told me that the tree that has the most fruits should always be prepared to be stoned.This analogy gave me a new perspective of my situation.It is when I realized that they were attacking me because I was doing and achieving something they wanted.I thus decided to show them that I never needed to cheat to be great at something.Thus,from class four till class six second term,I maintained position one overall.I was good to the point parents promised a reward to anyone who managed to beat me.This really motivated me.It was such a big deal to the point that when I was finally displaced and was position two,it was the topic of the month.This proved to me that I could do anything If I put my mind to it.Thus I decided to learn coding.In summary,I am proud that I got to prove that nobody was going to tell me what I could and could not do.
